***
Decided to build a calcultor using my knowledge of the three basic languages of front-end development 
>-HTML
>-CSS
>-Javascript
***
The calculator serves the 4 basic operations
>1.Addition
>2.Subtraction
>3.Multiplication
>4.Division
***
Decimal numbers are allowed with this calculator
It also allows erasing numbers, or even deleting evrything to start from scratch.
